    <title>DHIS2-DATIM: an ongoing collaboration</title>
    <para><emphasis>In less than three years, PEPFAR’s DATIM program has implemented HIV/AIDS
            programs in 700,000 facilities across the globe. DATIM, which stands for Data for
            Accountability, Transparency and Impact, is striving to reach the ambitious <link

            treatment target by 2020 to help end the AIDS epidemic.</emphasis></para>
    <para><emphasis>With DHIS2 technology at the very core of DATIM, and a tight collaboration
            between teams based in Washington and Oslo, learn more about how a country program
            evolved into what is now called the largest health program ever initiated by one country
            to address a disease. </emphasis></para>
    <section><title>DATIM: the background details</title>
        <para dir="ltr">In 2009 a DHIS2 pilot project was being tested in Rwanda. This project was
            an extension of a Tanzanian health program called Promise. After five years of
            thoroughly shaping and structuring this pilot project, DHIS2 was deployed successfully
            and became Rwanda’s first national HMIS. The expertise and experience of this project
            was then scaled up to an even bigger project; in 2014 DHIS2 became the underlying
            technology of the largest software system ever dedicated to ending the AIDS epidemic:
            PEPFAR’s DATIM project.</para></section>
    <section><title>A data revolution</title><para><emphasis>“Things happened very fast at the time,”</emphasis> recalls Mike Gehron, founder of
            the project. <emphasis>“Upon the completion of the Rwanda pilot project in November
                2014, a new Global AIDS coordinator took up office. Deborah L. Birx had a data
                revolution mandate that she declared; to roll out a highly granular health system
                monitored from Washington D.C., to reach 700,000 health facilities across the world
                - in just four months. As this project was aligned with everything we were hoping to
                do and already had in place, it was conceivable for us to go ahead with it.”
            </emphasis></para>
        <para>DATIM’s deployment manager, Mark DeZalia, came onboard and was assigned the role of
            involving all fifty countries in getting DATIM implementations up and running. HISP Oslo
            hosted intensive training academies. As the project picked up momentum, teams were
            formed, the system was set up and in late 2014, DATIM went live across the world.</para>

    <section><title>Prior to DATIM how did PEPFAR collect data?</title><para>As Steffen Tengesdal from <link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"
                xlink:href="https://baosystems.com/">BAO Systems</link> explains: <emphasis>“Before
                DATIM, every PEPFAR-funded country had their own system with different contractors
                on site. There was no commonality between the systems. Although the contractors were
                collecting the same indicators, combining those results in a meaningful way and then
                into a report for Congress, took up a lot of PEPFAR’s time and
                resources.”</emphasis></para></section>
    <section><title>Cloud hosting: the key to efficiency</title><para><emphasis>“Instead of maintaining 40 systems, now with DATIM, we have one big system, hosted
                in the cloud,”</emphasis> explains Steffen Tengesdal. <emphasis>“When data goes into
                the system, it's in real-time, and it’s therefore possible to see what’s happening
                in all the countries rather than having to reach out to the countries
                individually.”</emphasis></para>
        <para>Indeed, this greater visibility has helped DATIM to identify and direct resources,
            funding, and logistics to where it's the most needed. DATIM can monitor progress, detect
            data duplication, and troubleshoot with so much more ease now. <emphasis>“Instead of
                having an entire team trying to coordinate the data pooling, more time can be spent
                on the immediate analysis of data. This increases scalability, reliability and
                backups,”</emphasis> confirms Steffen Tengesdal. </para></section>
    <section><title>Moving towards 2020 targets faster than ever</title><para>PEPFAR is monitoring in incredible detail the movement towards their goals. Everything that
            DATIM collects is consistent with PEPFAR’s 90-90-90 objectives. PEPFAR's implementing
            partners set targets for 2017 and on a quarterly basis, everyone at the Washington
            headquarters gets to review the targets and progress, to see if any course correction is
            needed. There are common DATIM concepts implemented in a unique way for each country.
            The previous model of distributing resources has changed from an “equity” based model to
            a model where PEPFAR looks at “where resources are needed the most”. This ensures PEPFAR
            is distributing resources, care, and funds much better over its 700,000 operating units
            (countries).</para></section>
    <section><title>Observing through the GIS lens</title><para>PEPFAR is using GIS extensively with DATIM. It’s used to indicate the level at which PEPFAR is
            working and the level at which they are adding the implementation attributes. Every map
            is color-coded to say where the sensitive zones are located.</para>

        <title>Customization</title>
        <para><emphasis>“Although setting up the software was surprisingly easy,” </emphasis>recalls
            Steffen Tengesdal,<emphasis> “the developmental side was the most time-consuming, as
                many of the features for this application of DHIS2 involved some custom programming
                and changes to the core software.”</emphasis> Contractors such as BAO were involved
            in building up the functionality, building out the data forms, testing the data
            migration servers and so forth. </para>

        <title>Data security: FISMA, AWS and FedRAMP</title>
        <para>In the United States, every US government system has to meet a federal requirement
            called FISMA: the Federal Information Security Act. This act defines a comprehensive
            framework to protect government information, operations and assets against natural or
            man-made threats. To operate within a federal context, PEPFAR had to ensure that DATIM’s
            data was stored in a FISMA-compliant zone. AWS has such an area called <link
                xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"
                xlink:href="https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/fedramp/">FedRAMP</link> (the Federal
            Risk and Authorization Program), which is a risk management program that provides a
            standardized approach for assessing and monitoring the security of cloud products and
            services. Currently, a lot of the data flowing into DATIM has to be ushered through a
            series of approvals before it is available on PEPFAR’s dashboards, which can be viewed
            publicly at <link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"

        <title>Gathering reliable data in unstable contexts</title>
        <para>While having a standard set of indicators was an advantage, it was challenging to load
            in all the facilities and districts, and the geographic hierarchy of all the countries
            covered by DATIM. In certain countries where there is political instability, new
            districts are sometimes formed, or a province can suddenly be split in half. PEPFAR has
            to react fast to such changes to ensure that data is being captured correctly. This
            might at times require redoing the entire hierarchy of a country.</para>
        <para>Thanks to the data de-duplication app, data quality and data integrity has improved
            significantly. Before DATIM, implementing partners had the mind-bending task of checking
            rows and rows of spreadsheets to spot any data duplication occurrences</para>

        <title>The next steps for DATIM?</title>
        <section>
            <title>Developing DHIS2 extensibility</title>
            <para>To continue being eligible for funding, all of PEPFAR’s partners and NGOs have to
                report their data. However, in certain cases, partners have to migrate their data or
                enter it into DATIM. This situation is changing though, as DATIM teams are adding
                further integration abilities to DHIS2, allowing users to push their data into and
                through other systems, without there being any manual intervention required.</para>

            <title>Future trends: Creating an Open Health Information Exchange (OpenHIE)</title>
            <para><link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://ohie.org/"
                    >OpenHIE </link>was formed in early 2013 by a community of practitioners who
                agreed to open standards and a common protocol for sharing data amongst and between
                health related systems. PEPFAR is interested in this initiative and is working on
                wrapping DATIM in an interoperable OpenHIE container. The aim of this initiative is
                to enable data to be freely shared between many systems and stakeholders. With
                OpenHIE you can do many things such as mapping facility lists to health worker
                registries; scheduling doctors at facilities for certain services; using an open MRS
                (medical record system) to do patient monitoring, and so forth.</para>

            <title>OpenHIE and DATIM4U: a global health infrastructure</title>
            <para>Currently in development, DATIM4U (DATIM for Operating Units) is a new DHIS2
                component. DATIM is making this component available to their 1,500 implementing
                partners to support PEPFAR aggregate reporting. However, many of the workflows and
                software features can be applied to more generic use cases. With this solution,
                OpenHIE will be used to support aggregate data transactions that enable a country or
                an organization to send required indicator data to PEPFAR via an aggregate data
                transaction (ADX message). In addition to supporting the aggregate data exchange,
                metadata required to provide semantic interoperability is also being exchanged using
                the OpenHIE architecture and workflows. PEPFAR hopes to bring on board all of their
                countries and implementing partners with DATIM4U. The aim of the OHIE is also to
                encourage implementing partners to operate locally and to interconnect with their
                Ministries of Health. The outcome of this would be an international,
                standards-based, OpenHIE, that has no bounds around a particular type of health
                care. </para>

            <title>DATIM is here to stay</title>
            <para>According to Mike Gehron, <emphasis>“Although it was rolled out over the course of
                    just six months, DATIM took years of preparation.” “As sad as it is to say,”
                </emphasis>he adds, <emphasis>“you need an Ebola epidemic to get an environment
                    where people are moving fast, and where you have to find people who have
                    experience working in such an environment. Nobody had been through this process
                    before us, so there is now an entire generation of people who have experience
                    setting up a large system like DATIM.”</emphasis></para>
