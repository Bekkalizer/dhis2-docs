    <para>The <emphasis role="bold">Data Quality</emphasis> app contains tools to validate the
        accuracy and reliability of the data in the system. You can verify the data quality with the
        help of validation rules and various statistical checks. Data quality has different
        dimensions including:</para>

&quot;I’m not sure about this dimension, as we don’t have any checks for this that I can think of - even the «min max» is based on previously reported data and is more of a «consistency over time» check. &quot;"?>

            <para>At point of data entry, DHIS2 can check the data entered to see if it falls within
                the minimum maximum value ranges of that data element (based on all previous data
                registered).</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
            <para>By defining validation rules, which can be run once the user has finished data
                entry. The user can also check the entered data for a particular period and
                organization unit(s) against the validation rules, and display the violations for
                these validation rules.</para>

&quot;I’m not sure about these two - they’re data quality checks, but there is no functionality in DHIS 2 to do this so I guess they are not discussed any further in the manual.&quot;"?>
            <para>By analysing data sets, that is, examine gaps in the data.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
            <para>By data triangulation, that is, comparing the same data or indicator from
                different sources.</para>
